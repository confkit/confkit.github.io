                <p>ConfKit is a French non-profit organization. Our goal is to promote knowledge transfers in the tech industry. </p>
                <p>We think the only way to be a better developer is to learn from others - but the best way to become an expert is to <b>teach</b> others! </p>
                <p>
                  For now, our main focus is on <a href="https://frenchkit.fr">FrenchKit</a>, the iOS and macOS developer conference in Paris. But we have some cool projects in mind for the future!
